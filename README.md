## Welcome
Welcome to Intergen!

## Languages

* [JavaScript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/) - Used in all web projects due to it's popularity and ubiquitous support.
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles into plain old JavaScript. We use TypeScript extensively as it offers static type checking and ES6 feature support.
* [Less](http://lesscss.org/) - Our CSS preprocessor of choice as it allows us to write more maintainable CSS.
